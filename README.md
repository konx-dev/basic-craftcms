# CraftCMS Boilerplate - Basic Tier
Proof of concept for a craftcms install running headless multisites that offer simple sites built around a small suite of components utilising a page builder.

## Current State of Project
Local dev environment served from MAMP, version controlled to github with deployment hooks to push changes to a remote server. Overall goal of trying to remove extensive setup hurdles and allow for craftcms multisite clusters to be easily maintained and setup.

## Setup
